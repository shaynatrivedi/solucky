                            At first, solucky began as a blog to share the founderâ€™s passions with family & friends, 
                            where makeup, fashion, organization, decoration, & film intertwined. The blog soon gained 
                            popularity & blossomed into a multifaceted brand thanks to the endless support & 
                            collaboration of the community. In just a year, solucky evolved from a blog into a magazine,
                            fueled by contributions from a devoted team of volunteers.

                            Since its first magazine issue in March 2021, solucky has become a publication where every photo, 
                            video, article, & piece of art is infused with the dedication of its contributors. The brand became
                            a platform for a growing community of creatives, each contributing their passions & skills to build 
                            something greater than any one individual. Operating on no budget, each issue is a testament to the 
                            power of collaboration & community, with a unique theme & a space where creativity is not only shared 
                            but celebrated.
