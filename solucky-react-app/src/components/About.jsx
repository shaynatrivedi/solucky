              <p>
              Sanjana Solanki, a Bay Area native & 2024 Business Administration
              graduate from San Jose State University, created solucky as a creative
              outlet. Her passions for fashion, film, organization, decoration, & 
              makeup, along with her South Asian heritage, consistently shape the 
              brandâ€™s unique vision. Hobbies like thrifting, decorating, & photography 
              inspired her to create solucky, allowing her to showcase these interests
              & collaborate with some of the most dedicated & hardworking people she
              has ever met.

              <h1>The Brand</h1>
              <p>
              Founded by Sanjana in August 2020, the brand draws its name from a cherished 
              childhood memory. Inspired by her father's endearing reference to their family
              as "so-lucky," the name "solucky" was chosen to reflect a personal connection
              & resonate as a catchy, memorable brand identity.
