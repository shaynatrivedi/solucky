            <p>
            Sanjana Solanki, a Bay Area native & 2024 Business Administration
            graduate from San Jose State University, created solucky as a creative
            outlet. Her passions for fashion, film, organization, decoration, & 
            makeup, along with her South Asian heritage, consistently shape the 
            brandâ€™s unique vision. Hobbies like thrifting, decorating, & photography 
            inspired her to create solucky, allowing her to showcase these interests
            & collaborate with some of the most dedicated & hardworking people she
            has ever met.
